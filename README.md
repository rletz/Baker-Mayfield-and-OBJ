# Baker-Mayfield-and-OBJ
This was the first data analysis "project" I completed just a few weeks into learning Python. It may not be much, but at that time I was super proud of this project and wanted to include it here. So please take it easy on me on this one!

In this project, I analyze Baker Mayfield's 2020 season stats to measure his performance both before and after Odell Beckham Jr.'s injury to determine if he actually performed better without OBJ on the field.
